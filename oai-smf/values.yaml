# SMF needs two seperate interface one for http and other one for N4 to communicate with UPD.

# 1. you want seperate interface for N4 and Nsmf 
# 2. Your UPF is outside the cluster and the host machine can communicate but pods can not then you can provide ip-address in the same range as your host machine
# 3. You want static ip-address for N4 interface, Namf can be discovered by its service name
